# Learning about Version Control

Author: Timothy Singh

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

Opinions:
* Version control is very useful because there is a recorded history of what was done on a repository. The creation of branches allows for easy collaboration as well.

* However, version control can get a bit confusing and challenging when there are several users working on a single file in the same branch, since this would likely result in several merge conflicts.
